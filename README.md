# CS3214 - Frontend Website Configuration

This repository contains setup scripts for CS3214 website. The website is built using AngularJS and is a static website. Configuration changes to the website are done via a JSON file. Projects and exercises can be enabled or disabled via the static configuration. Redeployment of the website is required every time the configuration changes.

In order to set up the entire website from scratch, follow the steps below in the order:

* Pre-requisites
  * Setup semester specific routes: `python setup_semester.py`
  * [Installation of NVM](https://github.com/ashishbaghudana/cs3214-frontend-website#node-virtual-manager)
  * [Semester Configuration](https://github.com/ashishbaghudana/cs3214-frontend-website#semester-setup)
* [Node Application Setup](https://github.com/ashishbaghudana/cs3214-frontend-website#node-application-setup)

## Pre-requisites and Semester Setup

Use the Python script `setup_semester.py` to setup files for each semester. The script does a recursive grep for any pattern that matches `(spring|fall)\d+` and `(Spring |Fall )\d+` and replaces that with the current semester.

### Node Virtual Manager

We use nvm to manage npm and nodejs installations. The website is tested with node v11.4.0 and npm v6.4.1.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.0/install.sh | bash
nvm --version
nvm install node
```

### Semester Setup

The web application is configured using a JSON file that is placed within the directory `/home/courses/cs3214/admin/submissions/configurationFiles`. The file should be named as per the semester i.e. for Spring 2019, the file should be called `spring2019.json`. There are several fields in configuration file, including the semester name, TAs, lectures, and other documents. See the `config/` folder for more information.

## Node Application Setup

Setting up the application is straightforward. Navigate to the `node-app/` folder and use npm to install dependencies and run webpack.

```
cd node-app
nvm use node
npm install
npm run build
./publish.sh
```
