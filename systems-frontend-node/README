This project stores the frontend for the systems website and is based off the autograder frontend.

To publish the website run:

    `npm install`
    `npm run build`


This will generate all of the assets into the dist folder that can be served by a webserver.


DEPLOYMENT:
  copy the files from dist to the specified directory in /web/courses/cs3214/



Website-setup:
    There are 2 places that the frontend is configured, in src/config and semester specific configuration in a json file
    that is specified in src/config as semester_based_config.
