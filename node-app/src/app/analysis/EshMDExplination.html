<h1>EshMD</h1>
<p>The EshMD analysis consists of 2 components: static and dynamic.</p>
<p>The analysis asserts certain invariants about your submitted code and
    provides you with feedback on where they are invalidated. This can include invalid use of system calls
    as well as misuse of the provided base code (such as the list functions).</p>

<p>The static analysis looks at the code without running it.
    This is accomplished by taking multiple passes through your code having setting conditions to be true and false,
    and seeing what path through your code results.
    This allows us to find a pass in your code that could be executed that results in unwanted
    behavior.
</p>

<p>The dynamic analysis runs your code on a specific test case and looks at the actual behavior that your
    program exhibits.
    The initial run of EshMD will run on all of the tests run by <tt>stdriver.py</tt>.
    For the dynamic analysis we provide the instrumented executable for you to run on your own tests as well.

    <h3>
        Static Analysis Results
    </h3>
    <p>The static analysis will list all bugs found and link to the path taken that caused the bug.</p>
    <p>The example below shows a static analysis report that has flagged a double close on a file descriptor.</p>

    <p>Each bug report will show the annotated source code that traces the path through your code the static
        analyzer took to arrive at its conclusion.</p>

    <p>The static analysis will also flag general bugs, such as uninitialized variables.</p>

    <h3>
        Dynamic Analysis Results
    </h3>
    <p>The dynamic analysis will run each test and check the behavior of your shell.</p>
    <p>The results of a test from the EshMD dynamic analysis are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="label label-success">Pass</span> - The program passed the test and no behavior was
            flagged
        </li>
        <li><span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> - The program passed the test but EshMD flagged
            some behavior
        </li>
        <li><span class="label label-danger">Fail</span> - The program did not pass the test</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When EshMD flags an error, it will produce backtraces.
        You can use these to determine where in your code the error occurred.</p>
