                            Use the program <code>stdriver.py</code>.
                            This program is checked in the git repository in the <a href="https://git.cs.vt.edu/cs3214-staff/cs3214-esh/tree/master/eshtests">eshtests</a> directory, and it is also available in
                            <code>~cs3214/bin/stdriver.py</code>.
                        </p>
                            <p>Run <code>stdriver.py -h</code> to see its options. The test driver reads from a
                                .tst file that describes a test suite.  For instance, the tests for the minimum
                                required functionality are contained in <a href="https://git.cs.vt.edu/cs3214-staff/cs3214-esh/blob/master/eshtests/basic.tst">basic.tst</a>.  If you write your own tests for any functionality you
                                add, you must create a .tst with their relative locations to run those tests.
                            </p>
                            <p>If you wish to make changes to the tests (i.e., to add debug output etc.),
                                you can do so in your own copy, then tell stdriver.py to run those either via the
                                -B option, or simply by invoking the copy of stdriver.py that is located in your
                                eshtests directory.
                                Since stdriver.py was not there when you forked your repository
                                from the base code repository, you need to follow <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">these</a> instructions to pull the changes from the upstream repository into your working

                        <p>No. Built-in commands are executed by the shell without forking a new process.
                            Moreover, some built-in commands, notably <code>cd</code>, but also any command related to
                            environment variables (such as bash's <code>export</code> command), must be executed
                            in the shell's process or else their effect would vanish after the shell's child

                        <p>No. You don't need to implement the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html_node/Initializing-the-Shell.html#Initializing-the-Shell">initialization process</a> in this project.
                            You may assume that your shell is started in the foreground (i.e., has ownership of its
                            terminal) and is already in its own process group.  This will be the case if you test your shell by starting
                            it from bash (type "./esh"), and it will also be the case if the shell is started from the Python
                            test harness.  A more robust shell (suitable as a login shell) should do it, however.

                            Read the manual (<code>man 3p exec</code>) to learn about the different versions.
                            You may use any of them; a recommended function is execvp().

                        <p>
                            When a foreground process exits, the shell needs to reacquire the terminal
                            (by making its own process group the foreground process group of its
                            controlling terminal.)  This is done via tcsetpgrp().  Since the process
                            issuing the tcsetpgrp() is not in foreground group, the tcsetpgrp() call
                            will result in the delivery of SIGTTOU.  (The same rules that apply to
                            all processes apply to your shell, too.)  In this case, this creates
                            a catch-22: the shell itself needs to be the foreground process group
                            to call readline() to receive the next input from the user, but the
                            call needed to make the shell's process group the terminal's foreground
                            process group requires that the calling process already is part of the
                            foreground process group.  POSIX resolves this dilemma by stipulating
                            that the shell should block SIGTTOU during the call to tcsetpgrp(),
                            and that if it does, SIGTTOU will not be delivered.

                    <uib-accordion-group in-faq heading="When a foreground job is stopped and later resumed, do we need to make sure that the state of the terminal is preserved?">
                        <p>Yes. Some processes place the terminal in a special, so-called 'raw' state.  For instance, vi does that.
                            In 'raw' state, the program receives characters as they are typed.  (By contrast, in the 'cooked' state,
                            programs normally read lines of input.)  If a foreground job is suspended and later resumed, you need to save
                            and restore whatever state it placed the terminal in.  Use the provided functions in <code>esh-sys-utils.c</code>
                            for this purpose, which wrap the tcsetattr()/tcgetattr() functions.
                            Note that you do not need to understand what exact state the job put the terminal in.
                            On a related note, if a
                            process that places the terminal in the raw state is stopped, the shell must restore the original state of
                            the terminal before issuing the next prompt.  To that end, save the initial state of the terminal
                            when the shell is first started and restore this state whenever the shell outputs its prompt and
                            waits for user input.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rationale for this approach is that a job control shell must allow the execution of programs
                            that are themselves job control unaware, i.e., programs that assume they have exclusive control
                            of the terminal.

                    <uib-accordion-group in-faq heading="I'm confused about which signals we need to catch.">
                        <p>The only signal that you must catch is SIGCHLD. When SIGCHLD arrives, you need to reap
                            any children whose status may have changed and update the shell's data structures accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>Optionally, you may catch SIGINT (^C).
                            Catching SIGINT could be used, for instance, to allow
                            a user to abort a partially completed command line, like bash does.  You would need to use
                            sigsetjmp()/siglongjmp() to that end, as shown on a lecture slide. Note that when the user types
                            ^C, SIGINT will reach the shell only when it is in the foreground process group, which is the case
                            only while no other foreground job is running - namely, while the shell waits for
                            user input.  </p>
                        <p>When a foreground job is running, it will have ownership of the terminal.  This means that
                            the keys ^Z and ^C cause the OS to send SIGTSTP and SIGINT directly to the processes in the
                            foreground process group, and *not* to the shell.  So, for SIGTSTP and SIGINT to stop/terminate
                            your foreground process, you don't have to do any signal handling!</p>
                        <p>A second signal you may optionally catch or ignore is SIGTSTP. Like ^C, ^Z will reach the
                            shell only while waiting for user input.  You could ignore SIGTSTP so
                            that the shell isn't suspended itself when the user types ^Z instead of typing a command.
                            This is what most shells do, as you can observe by typing ^Z on a bash prompt.</p>

                        <p>These terms are often used synonymously, but they describe different aspects.
                            A pipeline is a sequence of one or more user commands separated by the pipe (|) symbol,
                            which will result in the execution of one or more processes.  Each pipeline forms a job.
                            A new process group is created for each job.  By convention, the first process of each
                            pipeline becomes the leader of the job's process group, the other processes join the
                            leader's process group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, put briefly, each pipeline is a job, and each job has its own process group.

                            tcsetpgrp() hasn't been called.  In addition, when you call tcsetpgrp(), the process

part of a pipeline have terminated?">
                        <p>No.  You will receive notifications for each process that's part of a pipeline/job.
                            They may exit in any order.  Your shell must manage this: for instance, if a pipeline/job
                            that consists of multiple processes is running in the foreground, the shell should not
                            prompt for new input until after all processes that are part of the job have been
                            reaped (and your shell received confirmation from the OS that they've terminated.)

                            that the status of each child can be reported, separately.  You will thus

                        <p>This may have several reasons.  A common one is that the output of
                            your shell does not match what the test script expects, and/or that you
                            haven't adapted the file describing the output format of your shell
                            accordingly.  Among others, the test harness expects that the name
                            of a job can be extracted via a regular expression from the job list.
                            In addition, it expects that the shell echoes the command line of a job
                            when it executes the 'fg' command.  (Like bash does.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another common failure mode is to forget to ensure that the regular
                            expression given by the variable <code>job_status_regex</code> in your
                            eshoutput.py must match the output your shell produces when a stop is
                            stopped (or in general its status is printed).  The default we provide
                            would assume your shell outputs job messages where the job is listed
                            inside parentheses, such as in:
                        <pre>

    the update is ignored/does not work.">
                        <p>A common mistake is to misunderstand the effect of fork().  When the shell calls fork(),
                            a new child process is created.  The child process will eventually call exec() to load the
                            program the user desired while the parent process will continue to implement the
                            shell functionality - wait for foreground jobs, implement job control etc.   The child process
                            obtains a copy of all data from the parent at the time fork() is called.  "All data" here
                            means all heap objects, all global, and all local variables.  This copy will have the same values that it had
                            before the fork(), but <b>any modifications affect only the child's copy.</b>
                            When the child execs, all of its data is wiped and replaced with the data of the new program.
                            So, code like this

                            is done before the fork(), or after the fork() in the context of the parent (shell) process.
                            Be aware that while you can use local/global variables and heap objects to pass information
                            from the parent to the child when it is forked, you cannot use those variables to pass information
                            back from the child to the parent, or from the parent to the child after the child has been forked.

                        <p>The strategy for using waitpid() correctly is a bit tricky. waitpid() must be called
                            on three code paths: when waiting for a process started as a foreground process to terminate,
                            when implementing the 'fg' command, and also from inside the SIGCHLD handler.
                        </p>
                        <p>You should call waitpid() in all of these situations with -1 as the first argument and
                            using the WUNTRACED option; when calling it in the SIGCHLD handler, also specify WNOHANG
                            using the bitwise | operator.
                        </p>
                        <p>To avoid race conditions, keep SIGCHLD blocked when calling waitpid() while waiting
                            for a foreground job.  (Note that SIGCHLD is blocked inside the SIGCHLD signal handler
                            already.) But do not keep SIGCHLD blocked all the time - when the shell sits at the
                            command prompt, waiting for user input, SIGCHLD must be unblocked so that the shell
                            can reap terminating children.</p>
                        <p>Since you are passing -1, it may happen that while waiting for a foreground job waitpid()
                            returns to tell you about a background job that terminated.  In that case, you must record
                            this information in your job list (since the OS will tell you only once about it!), and
                            then call waitpid() again. Here is a code snippet you can use
                            to implement this approach:
                        </p>
                        <div hljs include="'waitpidsketch'" language="c"> </div>
                        <p>Note also that even though the waitpid() call issued by the shell when waiting for
                            a foreground job will reap any children that have exited or changed status, a SIGCHLD
                            signal, once pending, will still be delivered as soon as you unblock SIGCHLD.
                            In that case, the OS has nothing to report when you call waitpid().
                            That's why you must use the WNOHANG flag in the SIGCHLD handler and that's why
                            you should ignore if waitpid() returns -1 there.

                        <p>The verb "to block" is used in at least two different meanings in operating systems.
                            Used as a transitive verb,
                            a process may "block" when it encounters a situation in which it cannot make progress.
                            For instance, a process may wait for some event (such as a read() operation to complete,
                            or a child process to exit, or simply for some time to pass).  In this case, we say the
                            process is blocked.  Blocked processes do not use CPU time.  They are unblocked when what
                            they're blocked on finally happens.  At that point, they become ready and the scheduler
                            will eventually resume them as soon as a CPU/core becomes available.
                        </p>
                        <p>Another meaning of "to block" uses block as an intransitive verb, as in "blocking a signal."
                            Blocking here means to
                            delay the delivery of a pending signal until some later point in time.  This is accomplished
                            by using an appropriate system call (sigmask(2) or sigblock(2)).  It is needed when there is
                            a potential for race conditions between the signal handler and the main control flow of
                            a program.

                        <i>... I thought the Unix line termination character was LF (<code>\n</code>)?</i>
                        <i>Or: ... How come ^Z shows up if I turn on logging in eshoutput.py - I thought ^Z results in

                        <p>The regular expressions in eshoutput.py refer to the information that is output
                            the master side of the pseudo terminal, and the logfile logs everything that is input into
                            the master side of the pseudo terminal.  Your shell, on the other hand, is connected to
                            the pseudo terminal's slave end.   The pty driver performs the same operations a regular
                            terminal driver would. It can also be customized in the same way.
                            For instance, if the flag <code>ONLCR</code> is set, it will transform a NL into a
                            CRLF (See termios(3); you can run <code>stty -a</code> to see which flags are enabled
                            by default for the pseudo terminal used by ssh.).  Similarly, if ^Z is sent to the
                            master end of the terminal, SIGTSTP will be sent to the terminal's foreground process job.

                            pty(7) summarizes the functionality provided by pseudo terminals:
                        <pre>
   A  pseudo-terminal  is a pair of virtual character devices that provide a bidirectional
   communication channel.  One end of the channel is called the master; the other  end  is
   called  the  slave.   The  slave  end of the pseudo-terminal provides an interface that
   behaves exactly like a classical terminal.  A process that expects to be connected to a
   terminal,  can  open the slave end of a pseudo-terminal and then be driven by a program
   that has opened the master end.  Anything that is written on the master end is provided
   to  the process on the slave end as though it was input typed on a terminal.  For exam-
   ple, writing the interrupt character (usually control-C) to  the  master  device  would
   cause  an  interrupt  signal  (SIGINT) to be generated for the foreground process group
   that is connected to the slave.  Conversely, anything that is written to the slave  end
   of  the pseudo-terminal can be read by the process that is connected to the master end.
   Pseudo-terminals are used by applications  such  as  network  login  services  (ssh(1),
   rlogin(1), telnet(1)), terminal emulators, script(1), screen(1), and expect(1).

                                family tree</a> you'll see two major branches: systems deriving from
                            System V on the left, and systems in the BSD line in the center. Linux,
                            on the right, now attempts to provide support for both lines; sometimes,
                            there are functions with the same name, but different signatures
                            (for instance, setpgrp()). Then you have to tell it which one you want by
                            defining certain pre-processor constants. In this assignment, you should
                            not need to use any such functions. Use setpgid() instead of setpgrp(),
                            and the only place where you would need to learn a process's process group
                            is to identify the shell's own process group. Use getpgrp() for this purpose,
                            as suggested in setpgid(2).  There is no need to ever call getpgid() on a process pid
                            other than your own (that is, the shell's).

                        <p>When POSIX signal handling is used, the OS will pass along additional information
                            to the signal handler in arguments #2 and #3.  Argument #2 is of type siginfo_t.
                            See  <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/sigaction.2.html">sigaction(2).</a>
                            However, since traditional Unix signals are not queued, si_pid for a SIGCHLD will contain
                            the pid of the first child that caused SIGCHLD to become pending.  Therefore, it cannot
                            be used to learn which children need to be reaped. You must use waitpid(-1, ...).

                        <p>Keep in mind that such messages are printed only if a (working) shell detects that one of its
                            child processes terminated with SIGSEGV.  Your shell will be the child process of your login shell
                            (typically bash); so if the segmentation fault occurs in your shell process, you'll likely see
                            the error message printed by bash.  However, if your shell crashes on the code path between
                            when it forks a new process (about to exec() a command), then it would be your shell's responsibility
                            to print this error message after waiting for the child.  If it does not do that yet, you won't
                            see anything.  valgrind is of great help here: it follows both the parent and the child process
                            and reports segmentation faults in either.

                            a variable of type <tt>sa_sigaction_t</tt> is expected.  This means you should declare your signal
                            handling routine to have this signature, then you can pass it to <tt>esh_signal_sethandler</tt> which
                            provides a convenient wrapper for the underlying sigaction(2) system call that installs this
                            signal handler. I recommend using this function instead of the outdated <tt>signal(2)</tt> function,
                            because it allows more fine-grained control over the signal processing semantics. For instance,
                            you can specify that system calls that are interrupted by a signal be automatically restarted;
                            you can specify that additional information be sent along to the signal handler routine (such as
                            in the case of SIGSEGV, where a program faulted), and you can specify exactly which additional
                            signals, if any, should be blocked during the execution of the signal handler.
                        </p>
                        <p>In my opinion, there's rarely a reason to use signal(2) anymore; however others have
                            pointed out that signal(2) is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/hello/manual/libc/Signal-and-Sigaction.html">part
                                of ISO C</a> and may be preferred for portability in general. However, <a href="http://www.schweikhardt.net/identifiers.html">as
                                shown in this table</a>, SIGCHLD is part of POSIX only and not part of ISO C, given its
                            Unix-specific semantics.  This differs from such signals as SIGINT or SIGSEGV, which can be meaningfully
                            implemented in any C language environment.</p>

                    <uib-accordion-group in-faq heading="Do we need to perform any signal-related setup for the programs our shell executes?">
                        <p>Recall that a process can dictate, for each signal with the exception of SIGKILL, what it wants to do
                            if that signal is raised (handle, ignore, or take the default action which may be termination). In addition,
                            for signals that it handles, it can temporarily delay their delivery by blocking them.
                        </p>
                        <p>If a process sets up any special handling for signals and/or blocks signals, any children of the process will
                            inherit such actions and they will also inherit the parent's signal mask (a bitmask describing which signals are blocked, if any).
                            So if your parent
                            shell blocks SIGCHLD when calling fork(), SIGCHLD will be blocked in the child.  (Note, however, that the child
                            is its own separate process for the purpose of signal delivery - the reasons for why it may receive SIGCHLD
                            are completely separate from why the parent process may receive SIGCHLD, or any of the other signals.
                            On fork(), pending signals that have not yet been delivered to the parent do not become pending in the child so that the child doesn't accidentally receive signals not intended for it.)
                        </p>
                        <p>If a process executes a new program, the signal handling is also largely unaffected, with one notable
                            exception: any signal that has a handler will be reset to the default action - this makes sense since the signal
                            handler itself belongs to the old program being replaced by the exec() call.  However, exec() does not
                            affect whether signals are ignored or blocked - a signal that is ignored or blocked will remain ignored or blocked.
                        </p>
                        <p>Your shell must make sure that new programs are started with reasonable signal settings for each
                            signal. That means that all signals have their default actions, and no signal is blocked.  Consequently,
                            if your shell blocked any signal (such as SIGCHLD) in the parent, the signal should be unblocked
                            in the child before the exec() call. Similarly, if you decide to ignore any signals (such as
                            SIGINT, perhaps), reinstall the default behavior before calling exec().  You may call
                            <tt>esh_signal_sethandler(SIGINT, (sa_sigaction_t) SIG_DFL);</tt> to that end.  Otherwise,
                            the child process would ignore SIGINT, and you couldn't terminate it with ^C.
                            You do not need to reset signals you handle, such as SIGCHLD, to their default action -
                            exec() will do that for you.

                        <p><b>Answer:</b> You do not have ownership of the terminal when you call readline().
                            Readline() assumes it has ownership so it can safely call, for instance, tcsetattr() - which
                            is a function that requires such ownership.  If that's not the case, readline() will
                            act in undefined ways (apparently blindly retrying over and over after SIGTTOU is sent.)
                        </p>
                        <p>In the example shown above, the most likely reason is that you wrongly gave ownership
                            of the terminal to the 'sleep 30 &' background job the user started.  If the user starts
                            a job in the background, that job must not be given ownership of the terminal.
                        </p>
                        <p>In order to not have to separately handle the case where a foreground job (which must
                            be given ownership of the terminal!) terminates or exits, it may be useful to simply
                            also reacquire ownership before calling readline() (or even better, before printing
                            anything, including the prompt).
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that you still must avoid giving terminal ownership to the background job to
                            avoid the race condition where the background job (in the child process, before the
                            exec()), snaps away ownership from the shell that's already returned to the prompt.

                    <uib-accordion-group in-faq heading="When I add the second process of a pipeline to the pipeline's
    process group, setpgid() fails with EPERM 'Operation not permitted'">
                        <p>This occurs when the process group to which you are trying to add the process
                            no longer exists, for instance, because all the processes in it have already terminated.
                            This can occur if you (erroneously) wait for the first child in a pipe to finish
                            before forking the second child.
                        </p>
                        <p>Waiting for the first child also breaks a pipe's built-in flow control
                            mechanism. If the first child outputs more than the pipe's bounded buffer capacity, it will block
                            forever since you never start the second child that would have otherwise drained
                            the pipe and consumed the data produced by the first child.
                            In current Linux kernel's, a pipe's capacity is only 64K.
                            In addition, you're giving up parallelism.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Linux man page for setpgid() is incomplete in that it does not list the
                            case where pgrp no longer exists.  Even though EPERM seems unusual here - ESRCH
                            would perhaps have been more clear to the user, <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/setpgid.html">POSIX 1003.1/2013 actually calls for EPERM</a> here:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
[EPERM]
    The value of the pgid argument is valid but does not match the process ID
    of the process indicated by the pid argument and there is no process with
    a process group ID that matches the value of the pgid argument in the same
    session as the calling process.

                        <p>A good way to get started is to read the book chapter (8), then read the provided code.
                            A reasonable first milestone could be the execution of a single program (along with command
                            line arguments) in the foreground.  That is, get your shell to run commands such as <code>ls</code>
                            and return to the prompt when they have finished.

                        <i>(No one has really asked that question yet, and I don't know if anyone has considered that, either.)</i>
                        <p>I think so, although you'll be trading one set of complexity for another and you'll need to learn
                            some additional system calls.
                        </p>
                        <p>Signal handlers have the drawback that they introduce asynchronous control flow in your program:
                            while SIGCHLD is not blocked/masked, it may arrive at any point in time and cause your SIGCHLD
                            handler to be executed.  If you use <code>signalfd()</code>, you can instead learn when a signal
                            has become pending, then execute a read() system call to consume it without ever invoking the
                            signal handler, thus avoiding asynchronous control flow.
                        </p>
                        <p>Learning when the signal has become pending requires learning when that file descriptor
                            has become readable (e.g., it is possible to call read() without causing the process to be
                            blocked inside the read() system call waiting for a signal). You need to use select(2) or a
                            similar call for that.  The problem you are facing then is that you need to also read
                            user input after the shell has output its prompt.
                        </p>
                        <p>Fortunately, the readline() function esh uses has an <a href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/readline/rlman_41.html">alternate API</a> designed for this purpose
                            in the <code>rl_callback_*</code> family of functions.  Read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1706678/ncurses-and-stdin-blocking">this example</a>
                            on stackoverflow to get the general idea.  Thus, your main function must set up a signal file descriptor, then execute a
                            select() loop in which it selects both on stdin and the signal fd.  If stdin becomes readable, it'll call
                            <code>rl_callback_read_char()</code>, if the signal fd becomes readable, it needs to reap all children
                            that can be reaped at this point in time (again using WNOHANG in a loop).  (As before, SIGCHLD is
                            not queued.)
                            The shell will perform command line processing if <code>rl_callback_read_char()</code> calls the handler
                            installed with <code>rl_callback_handler_install()</code>.

                        <p>Yes! Making a copy is not necessary, but make sure you remove the call to the <code>esh_command_line_free</code>

                        <p>The provided list implementation requires that you remove an element from the list that contains it <b>before</b>
                            you place it into another list. Otherwise, the list elements in the old list will still point to the element.
                            Thus, if you are using the linked list of pipelines produced by the parser, make sure you remove them from the
                            command line list before adding them to your jobs list.  <code>list_pop_front()</code> may be used here, inside
                            the body of a while loop that checks if the remaining list is empty.

                        <p>In most cases, if you reliably pass the tests when you run them, they will also pass when we run them.
                            However, since this assignment is done in C, and C is a type-unsafe language that makes it <a ng-href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/wang-stack.pdf">easy to write code that invokes undefined behavior</a>, you should use proper development
                            and debugging techniques to rule those out to the extent possible.  This includes, for one, using a high level
                            of compiler warnings (<tt>-Wall -Werror</tt>, as pointed out in this FAQ - though you could turn on additional
                            warnings (<tt>-Wextra</tt>)).  Second, we urge you to run your shell under valgrind and exercise its functionality
                            (use job control, etc.).  This will flag, for instance, if your shell passes uninitialized data to system calls
                            which can make you fail tests under certain runtime conditions.
