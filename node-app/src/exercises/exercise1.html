        <p>Each student will reverse engineer their own unique version of dpipe.
            Please make sure you reverse engineer your version. Your answers will differ from those
            of your fellow students. There are over 300,000 unique ways (primarily because
            some of the system calls involved can be issued in any order, creating numerous
            possible combinations).</p>
        <p>For pid <span class="text-primary">{{exercise1.pid}}</span>, your unique version is located
            in <span class="text-primary">~cs3214/bin/dpipe.variants/dpipe-{{exercise1.dpipeid}}</span> on rlogin.

                        <i>.... or using 'ps -e'?</i>
                        <p>Either because you're running ps on a different machine than the dpipe process, or because
                            dpipe isn't running anymore when you run ps.
                        </p>
                        <p>To exclude the former, run 'hostname' on your prompt, or better, equip yourself
                            with a <a

                        <p>To exclude the latter, make sure that the shell has not returned to the prompt. See next

                        <p>Likely because you do not have <tt>~cs3214/bin</tt> in your <tt>PATH</tt>.
                            In this case, dpipe's attempt to exec("gnetcat") will fail, but unlike a proper shell, dpipe
                            will silently ignore that error and exit. You get the shell prompt back in this case.</p>

                        <p>You are looking either on the wrong machine's <tt>/proc</tt> directory or you are looking

                            information is accessible to all users, some of it is accessible to only to the user that
                            owns a process,
                            and all of it is accessible to the superuser.
