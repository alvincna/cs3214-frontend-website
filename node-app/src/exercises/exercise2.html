                            linker.x where .x is the suffix corresponding to your programming language,

                        Not necessarily.
                        You should ensure that all cases are covered - use gcc and nm to produce your own.

                    <uib-accordion-group in-faq heading="Does the order in which symbols appear in the output matter?">
                        <p> Yes,

                            Though a linker is technically able to produce multiple legal layouts, for the purposes of
                            this exercise, you should produce the same order.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            That is, symbols should be laid out contiguously, and appear in the same relative order in
                            the output and in the input file (that's the behavior of the default linker, so you can
                            verify if your simulator does the same.)
