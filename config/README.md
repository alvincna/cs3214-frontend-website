# CS3214 Frontend and Autograder Configuration

`semester_format.json5` explains the different fields in the configuration file for each semester. JSON5 is an extension of JSON which allows unquoted strings and comments. It can be converted to JSON using a npm package called `json5` that can be installed by running `npm install -g json5`.

Edit the semester configuration and place it in `/home/courses/cs3214/admin/submissions/configurationFiles`. Name the file according to the semester it refers to. For example: the configuration file for spring2019.json should be present at `/home/courses/cs3214/admin/submissions/configurationFiles/spring2019.json`.

The current semester (Spring-2019) configuration is also placed here as a sample.
