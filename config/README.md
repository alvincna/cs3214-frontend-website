# CS3214 Frontend and Autograder Configuration

`semester_format.json5` explains the different fields in the configuration file for each semester. JSON5 is an extension of JSON which allows unquoted strings and comments. It can be converted to JSON using a npm package called `json5` that can be installed by running `npm install -g json5`.

Edit the semester configuration and place it in `/home/courses/cs3214/admin/submissions/configurationFiles`.

The current semester (Spring-2019) configuration is also placed here as a sample.
